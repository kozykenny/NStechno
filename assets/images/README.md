# Logo

Place your **NS Techno logo** here as:

- **Filename:** `logo.png`
- **Background:** Transparent (PNG with alpha). Remove the light blue gradient background so the logo blends with the site’s dark theme. You can use [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg), Photoshop, GIMP, or similar to export a transparent PNG.

The logo is used in the header and footer. Recommended: emblem + “NSTechno” text in one image, around 360×112px or similar aspect ratio.
